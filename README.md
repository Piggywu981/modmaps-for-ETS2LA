# modmaps-for-ETS2LA
A personal repo for displaying maps generated with https://github.com/JimJokes/maps

These maps will finally be packed into data.zip and work in [ETS2LA](https://github.com/orgs/ETS2LA)'s plugin "Maps"

**I'm happy to welcome everyone who's interested to contribute to this project o(*////â–½////*)q**
